        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Kitties & Doggies of Graz, located in the heart of Graz,
          Austria.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by Pauline and Gregor, Kitties & Doggies of Graz is more than
          just an animal shelterâ€”it's a labor of love inspired by our very own
          furry friend, Mimi. Mimi, a beloved cat adopted from an animal
          shelter, ignited a passion within us to make a difference in the lives
          of animals in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Mission At Kitties & Doggies of Graz, our mission is to provide a

          and community support, we strive to create a haven where tails wag,
          purrs resonate, and animals find the love and warmth they deserve.
